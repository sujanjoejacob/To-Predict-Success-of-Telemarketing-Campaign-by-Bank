# To-Predict-Success-of-Telemarketing-Campaign-by-Bank

The European bank wantsto know potential customers who can secure term deposit with the bank.
A set of information has been collected through tele-marketing campaign for the purpose.
We have proposed a predictive modelling approach to know the success rate of telemarketing
campaign. A large data set named “bank.csv” of 41,188 observations with 20 features was analysed
related to bank client, product and social-economic attributes.
Data preparation was done for making predictive data models & further analysis which can
determine the main characteristics that affect success and selection of potential buying customers.
Four machine learning algorithms Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector
Machine (SVM) were applied on the cleaned dataset. Decision Trees was chosen as the best model
based on confusion matrix and accuracy scores. This model was used to predict outcome for the
additional dataset provided. The most popular tool R was used to complete the project
It has been observed that increasingly vast number of marketing campaigns over a time has reduced
its effect on the general public. Economic pressures and competition have led marketing managers
to invest on directed campaigns with a strict and rigorous selection of contacts. Although
telemarketing is a direct mode of communication with the prospective customer, this may make
customers grumpy, contacts should be planned optimistically which will give better success rate.
